# Open4Es-Shader-Android
This is a shader can running on **Minecraft Java Edition For Phone** project which uses [GL4ES](https://github.com/ptitSeb/gl4es). Such as [Pojavlauncher](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam) and [Mcinabox](https://github.com/AOF-Dev/MCinaBox). Currently only Snapdragon devices are supported.

Due to misleading and copyright name stuff, there's no way to update the branches with the famous Java shader name anymore
